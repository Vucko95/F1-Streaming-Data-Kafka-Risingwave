## Technologies Used

The Formula 1 Streaming Data Pipeline project leverages a combination of cutting-edge technologies to deliver real-time data processing and visualization:

- **Formula 1 Data Source**: The project relies on the Formula 1 dataset obtained from ErgastAPI. This dataset serves as the primary source of Formula 1 race data for real-time streaming and visualization.

- **Kafka**: Kafka is a foundational element of this streaming pipeline, serving as a robust distributed data streaming platform. 

- **RisingWave (Streaming Database)**: RisingWave serves as the core streaming database, efficiently storing and managing real-time Formula 1 data.

- **Grafana Dashboard**: To visualize live Formula 1 data dynamically, Grafana is employed. It provides a versatile platform for creating customized dashboards, real-time charts, and data visualization tools. 

- **Kafka UI**: Offers user-friendly graphical interfaces for efficient Kafka topic inspection, simplifying the tracking and comprehension of data flow within the streaming pipeline.
